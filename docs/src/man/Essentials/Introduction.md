# Introduction

Essentials of the Hamiltonian package, which defines all the imported constants, types and functions when using `import Hamiltonian` or `using Hamiltonian`. Note that this submodule depends on the `Utilities` submodule although the variables in the latter are not exported to the scope of `Hamiltonian` by default.
