Based on this symbolic representation, we implement several algorithms, such as TBA, ED, CPT/VCA, DMRG, etc., to solve the quantum lattice system. Generic interfaces are offered to access to these algorithms. Only minor modifications need be made when the user alters from an algorithm to another."

    "text": "Althogh we can get the symbolic representation of the Hamiltonian by our unitcell-description framework, there still remains a long way to implement concrete algorithms such as TBA, ED, etc. Despite the quite different techinal details, algorithms shares common functionalities to be furnished with:provide tasks to be conducted with controlling parameters;\nrecord the results of some tasks for later use or analysis;\nupdate some parameters of the Hamiltonian to reconduct tasks;\nkeep logs during code executions for debug;\ncahe intermediate data to improve efficienty;\n...We thus provide a set of generic interfaces to resolve these problems, basiscally in the so called Engine-App mode. Specifically, algorithms are treated as Engine and taks as App. Engine deals with the cores of algorithms along with file mangament, parameter updating and data caching, while App decides the concrete tasks to be conducted and provides hyper controlling parameters."

Here we only implement Abelian good quantum numbers because non-Abelian ones are far more complicated yet much less used. In practice, good quantum numbers can be integers or half integers, therefore, we use real numbers to denote them in this module for simplicity. Independent quantum numbers, such as the particle number and the spin z-component, can coexist at the same time. We use type QuantumNumber to represent the complete set of independent ones for a single basis of a Hilbert space, and type QuantumNumbers to represent the whole quantum numbers for the total bases."
